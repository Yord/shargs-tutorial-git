## Code

The code we will write in this tutorial is available as the `git` script in this repository.
To run it, first setup the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Yord/shargs-tutorial-git.git
$ cd shargs-tutorial-git
$ npm i
$ chmod +x ./git
```

Then execute the script:

```bash
$ ./git --help
```

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will build a command-line interface that resembles `git`.
I assume, you are already familiar with `git`, but even if you are not, you should be able to follow.

Let us start with installing some shargs packages:

```bash
$ npm install --save --save-exact shargs@0.24.4 shargs-opts@0.5.0 shargs-parser@0.6.0 shargs-usage@0.6.0
```

Note that we install fixed versions.
This tutorial should work with these exact versions, and might work with newer versions.
However, this tutorial may not work if you use different versions.

### Parser

We start with a minimal shargs parser:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const {parserSync} = require('shargs')

const parser = parserSync()
const parse  = parser()

const argv   = process.argv.slice(2)
const res    = parse(argv)

console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2))
```

We choose to write a synchronous parser by importing `parserSync`.
Next, we initialize a new `parser`.
Calling the `parser` returns a `parse` function.

The `parse` function is then used to process `argv` argument values.
Note, that we skip the first two parameters of `process.argv`.
Those are always `node` and the file name.
Finally, we `log` the result to the `console`.

Let us now call this minimal shargs parser to see what it prints out.

<details>
<summary>
<code>$ ./git</code>
</summary>

<br />

```json
{
  errs: [
    {
      code: "CommandExpected",
      msg: "Expected a command with a string 'key' field and an 'opts' array.",
      info: {opt: {}}
    }
  ],
  args: {
    _: []
  }
}
```

`parser` reports a `CommandExpected` error.
The shargs documentation has a table of error codes,
where we can look up [`CommandExpected`](https://github.com/Yord/shargs/tree/0.24.4#CommandExpected).
We find out, that the error is thrown in the `toOpts` stage.

The problem is, that we did not provide an `opt` parameter to `parser`.
Note though, that the parser did work anyway, by reporting an error, helping us along the way.

</details>

### Command

Our first `parser` did not parse anything, but instead reported an error.
We can make it work by adding a `command`:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const {parserSync} = require('shargs')
const {command} = require('shargs-opts')

const git    = command('git', [])

const parser = parserSync()
const parse  = parser(git)

const argv   = process.argv.slice(2)
const res    = parse(argv)

console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2))
```

We added a `git` `command` that has no options, yet.
`git` is then passed to `parser`.
Let us have a look at what changed.

<details>
<summary>
<code>./git --help</code>
</summary>

<br />

```json
{
  errs: [],
  args: {
    _: ["--help"]
  }
}
```

The error is gone and we have `args`.

Note that `git` does not have options.
This is why `"--help"` does not mean anything to the `parser`.
It ends up in the <em>rest array</em> `_`, that holds all tokens that could not be interpreted.

</details>

### Options

Let us add a `--help` option to the `git` `command`, next:

```js
// ...
const {flag} = require('shargs-opts')

const opts = [
  flag('help', ['--help'])
]

const git = command('git', opts)
// ...
```

We chose to make `help` a `flag`, so we can just call `--help` without any values.

Now we should be able to parse `--help`:

<details>
<summary>
<code>./git --help</code>
</summary>

<br />

```json
{
  errs: [],
  args: {
    _: [],
    help: { type: "flag", count: 1 }
  }
}
```

The `_` array in `args` is empty, and we have successfully parsed `--help` into the `help` field.

Note that while `--help` is the command-line argument we use, `help` (without `--`) is the field name.
This is reflected in the definition of the `flag`.
Shargs separates between the external API of providing an argument, and the internal API of storing the values.

</details>

### Parser Stages

`--help` is parsed into a weird flag object with a `count` field.
However, we do not need to know, how often `--help` has been called,
we only need to know if it has been provided at least once.

So we do not need a `flag` value, a `bool` is enough:

```js
// ...
const {flagAsBool} = require('shargs-parser')
// ...
const stages = {
  args: [flagAsBool('help')]
}

const parser = parserSync(stages)
//...
```

We have modified `parser`'s behavior by adding an `args` stage to its `stages` parameter.
[`flagAsBool`](https://github.com/Yord/shargs#flagAsBool) transforms a `flag` with a given key (here `'help'`) into a bool.

Shargs works in seven different [steps](https://github.com/Yord/shargs#stages) that each take one or more stages.
The `args` step is at the sixth position.

Let us see `stages` in action.

<details>
<summary>
<code>./git --help</code>
</summary>

<br />

```json
{
  errs: [],
  args: {
    _: [],
    help: true
  }
}
```

The `help` field is now `true`.
